In this interview, Ross Stambaugh reflects on 25 years of practicing and teaching Ashtanga yoga. He shares his journey from discovering the practice in Cincinnati to his many visits to Mysore, where he continues to deepen his understanding. Learn how Ashtanga has shaped his life both on and off the mat.

### How did you get introduced to Ashtanga yoga?
I believe it was August 14th, 1999. I was walking down the street in Cincinnati, Ohio (USA) and I stopped into a headshop. There, I saw a video of Richard Freeman doing the Primary Series. He pressed up into a handstand, and I thought it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I had just graduated college, finished a swimming career, and didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. Anyway, I bought the video and played it until it broke. By that time, I was able to do about the first half of the Primary Series.

### So you've been practicing for almost 25 years?
Yes, with maybe a few weeks off at some point and while cross-training as well. Yoga has been with me since that day in August. I taught myself Primary Series, then I found out that other people practiced this style and that there was Second Series and even Third and Fourth Series. So around 2007, I started to take workshops with teachers. Tim Miller, David Swenson, Matthew Darling from Detroit, Michigan.

### So when did you start going to Mysore and how did you like it?
I started going to Mysore around 2013 or 2014. My first trip was amazing. I only could stay for two months and I thought I would never be able to go back. I returned home and kept practicing and kept teaching art at the public school. I have returned 7 times since then, this December being my 8th trip. And I get more and more excited with each visit.


### And you are authorized by Saraswati Jois? What's the difference between being authorized by her and Sharath Jois (her son)?
Yes, Saraswati authorized me after my third and fourth trip(s). The standard of asana to teach is about the same. A student should be pretty good at the Primary Series and Second Series and should show dedication to the practice. Saraswati requires you to know some chanting and she watches you teach for a while before she authorizes you. She looks for qualities beyond just proficiency in yoga postures.


### And you're a full-time traveling yoga teacher?
No! I was a public school teacher for the past 23 years and have taught yoga workshops on the weekends. I taught more and more when I had the summers off. I've taught all across the USA, Brazil, Spain, Italy, Croatia, Turkey, Vietnam, Kazakhstan, India, England... It's been great!


### And what do you usually teach at your workshops?
I do the greatest hits, like Mysore style practice of course, chanting, pranayama, philosophy, but really I try to keep the integrity of what I was taught. And just be there to help the new students. I am in awe of students now. There is so much exposure for new students to learn, YouTube, Instagram, Zoom. It's amazing. But it still doesn't beat practicing in a shala with a teacher watching. That still is the best.

### In addition to practicing yoga asanas, it seems you are also interested in several other physical activities, like judo or rock climbing. Do you think it's possible to pursue these simultaneously, or does one inevitably interfere with the other over time?
Pursuing multiple physical activities like yoga, judo, and rock climbing simultaneously is certainly possible and can even be beneficial. Yoga, in particular, can complement and enhance other physical practices due to its focus on flexibility, balance, and body awareness. 

That said, it's important to remember that the essence of yoga extends beyond just the physical asanas. At its core, yoga is about mindfulness and intentionality in our actions. In this light, any activity pursued with full awareness and thoughtfulness can embody the spirit of yoga. So while practicing yoga asanas alongside other sports can offer physical benefits, approaching all your activities - be it judo, rock climbing, or even daily tasks - with the mindfulness cultivated in yoga practice can transform them into a form of yoga themselves. The key is to bring that same level of presence, breath awareness, and intentionality to everything you do. 

This approach not only minimizes potential interference between different physical practices but can actually create a synergy where each activity enhances the others through improved body awareness, mental focus, and overall mindfulness. 


### What changes has intensive yoga practice brought into your life? I'm not thinking primarily about the physical aspects, but more about how it has shaped your mindset, your inner life, or perhaps your relationships?
Intensive yoga practice has transformed my life in ways I never expected when I first stepped onto the mat. Beyond the physical benefits, it's reshaped my entire approach to life. 

One of the most profound changes I've noticed is how yoga has taught me to create space - both in my mind and in my daily life. This spaciousness has allowed situations to unfold naturally, without my constant need to control or intervene. I've found myself becoming more patient, more open to possibilities I might have missed before. Viewing life through the lens of yoga philosophy has been eye-opening. 

The principle of non-attachment, for instance, has helped me navigate the ups and downs of my career with more grace. I no longer cling so tightly to successes or dwell so heavily on setbacks. This shift has brought a sense of freedom I never knew I was missing. 

In my relationships, the practice of ahimsa (non-violence) has deepened my capacity for compassion. I've become a better listener, more understanding of others' perspectives, and kinder to myself in moments of self-doubt. 

The emphasis on present-moment awareness has been a game-changer for me. I used to constantly worry about the future or ruminate on the past, but yoga has anchored me more firmly in the now. This mindfulness has spilled over into all areas of my life - I'm more focused at work, more present with my loved ones, and more appreciative of life's simple pleasures. 

Yoga's holistic approach has led me to a more balanced lifestyle. I'm more in tune with my body's needs, more aware of my thought patterns, and feel a stronger connection to something greater than myself. This sense of interconnectedness has given me a renewed sense of purpose and meaning. In essence, yoga has become more than just a practice for me - it's a way of being. 

It's given me tools to navigate life's complexities with greater ease and insight, continuously opening up new perspectives and possibilities in my personal journey. 

**I'm looking forward to visiting Budapest for two weeks and getting to know the students longer than just a short weekend. November will be a great time! Budapest is such a beautiful and historic city. The autumn weather should be perfect for exploring - not too hot, but still pleasant enough to enjoy outdoor activities. I've heard the thermal baths are a must-visit, especially the Széchenyi Thermal Bath. It'll be a nice way to relax after our yoga sessions. Ross Stambaugh**
