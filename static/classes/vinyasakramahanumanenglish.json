  "class": "Vinyasa krama yoga - Hanuman series",
  "shortdescription": "<p>The difficulty level of the class: <strong>easy.</strong></p><br />\n<p>The asanas in the <strong>HANUMAN</strong> (monkey-headed God) series help strengthen the leg muscles, open the hip area, and focus on strengthening the back muscles. Through persistent and regular practice, our body becomes more flexible and energetic, and with the help of breathing, we calm our mind. This is a lighter series that prepares for the Monday and Wednesday classes, so it's also recommended for beginners. Everyone can find a challenge in it, which can serve as a good foundation for further development.</p>",
