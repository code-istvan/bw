  "shortdescription": "<p>\n  Level of difficulty: <strong>easy</strong>.\n</p>\n<br/>\n<p>\n The sequence named after <strong>HANUMAN</strong> (Monkey King) aims to preserve 'raksana', which means 'preservation'; its focus is on maintaining health, reducing stress, and rejuvenation. Staying within the vinyasa system, we primarily concentrate on stretching, recognizing the belief and perseverance behind it. This is a physically light-hearted, full-body workout class, where both beginners and advanced practitioners can take their practice to a deeper level.\n</p><br/>\n<p>\n  To participate, you must purchase ticket or pass online in advance or have a valid pass.
