  "shortdescription": "<p>\n  Level of difficulty: <strong>intermediate</strong>.\n</p>\n<br/>\n<p>\n  In the <strong>NAGARAJA </strong>(serpent king) vinyasa krama sequence, we create a safe foundation for deep backbends through the activation and development of the bandhas (muscle locks). Consequently, the practitionerâ€™s spine becomes stronger and more flexible, achieving the suppleness akin to that of the great Serpent King.\n</p><br/>\n<p>\n  To participate, you must purchase ticket or pass online in advance or have a valid pass. To buy a day ticket or season ticket, click on the \"Tickets\" button.\n</p>",
