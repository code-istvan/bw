  "shortdescription": "<p>\n  Level of difficulty: <strong>intermediate</strong>.\n</p>\n<br/>\n<p>\n<strong>GANESHA</strong> Â is the lord of beginnings and obstacles, his power removes all barriers. The vinyasa krama sequence named after the elephant-headed God focuses on hip opening. We carry the impressions of past events in this area of our body, which can be gradually released through asanas and breathing over time. During the practice, balance exercises and easier arm supports also play an important role, with the aim of quieting the thoughts.\n</p><br/>\n<p>\n  To participate, you must purchase ticket or pass online in advance or have a valid pass.
